![House Prices](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/xyz/house_prices_banner.jpg)

## Overview
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to predict house prices using various regression techniques. Our goal is to leverage data science to provide accurate and reliable predictions, enabling better decision-making in the real estate market.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare raw data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transform and engineer features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implement and train regression models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using key metrics.
- **Model Deployment**: Serialize and deploy models for real-time prediction.

cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Follow the steps below to run the project:

1. **Load Data**: Place your dataset in the `data/raw_data` directory.
2. **Run Preprocessing**: Execute the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
3. **Train Model**: Train the model using the prepared data.
4. **Evaluate Model**: Assess the model's performance.

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature transformation, and encoding categorical variables. These steps ensure that the data is clean and ready for model training.

```python
def load_data(path):
    return pd.read_csv(path)

def preprocess_data(data):
    # Implement preprocessing steps
    return processed_data
```

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance. Techniques used include log transformation and encoding categorical variables.

```python
def feature_engineering(data):
    # Implement feature engineering steps
    return engineered_data
```

## Model Training
Train the Lasso regression model using the preprocessed data. The model is saved for future predictions.

```python
def train_model(data, target):
    model = Lasso(alpha=0.001, random_state=0)
    model.fit(data, target)
    joblib.dump(model, 'models/lasso_regression.pkl')
```

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (R2). These metrics help in understanding the model's performance.

```python
def evaluate_model(model, test_data, test_target):
    predictions = model.predict(test_data)
    mse = mean_squared_error(test_target, predictions)
    r2 = r2_score(test_target, predictions)
    return mse, r2
```

## Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model for making real-time predictions. The model and scaler are loaded to transform new data and make predictions.

```python
def predict(data):
    model = joblib.load('models/lasso_regression.pkl')
    predictions = model.predict(data)
    return predictions
```
